<p>IPOs are hot again. Naturally, the press is focused on high-profile offerings like Facebook&#8217;s. But, I think there is a more important group of companies going public: Smaller, less sexy Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startups. Think of it as the Sexy IPOs versus the SaaS-y IPOs.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t household names, but the most recent SaaS IPOs (<a href="http://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/">Cornerstone</a>, <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive</a>, <a href="http://www.brightcove.com/en/">Brightcove</a> and <a href="http://www.bazaarvoice.com/">Bazaarvoice</a>) are doing better in the public markets, on average, than the Sexy IPOs of LinkedIn, Groupon and Zynga.</p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t just their performance that matters &#8212; the recent IPOs of those cloud-based software companies (plus earlier ones from <a href="http://www.successfactors.com/homepage.html">Successfactors</a>, <a href="http://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml">Netsuite</a>, and <a href="http://www.concur.com/">Concur</a>) are harbingers of several important trends:</p>
<h5>Healthy Valuations with sub-$100M in Revenue</h5>
<p>The SaaS companies have gone public with annual revenue in the range of $50-$100M and are valued at anywhere from $500M to $1B at IPO. Several are now trading well above $1B. VCs have been waiting for 10 years for the public markets to consistently accept new issues with less than $100M in revenue. This is an important development as it means VCs can exit companies sooner in the investment cycle.</p>
<h5>Strong Trading Performance since IPO</h5>
<p>As a group, Cornerstone, Jive, Brightcove and Bazaarvoice are up 64% since their IPOs. Earlier SaaS IPOs like Concur and Netsuite are up 375% and 88%, respectively, since their debuts. Finally, don&#8217;t forget that Successfactors went public at $10/share and was recently acquired by SAP at $40/share!</p>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong> The SaaS IPOs are training public market investors that they can generate strong returns when they invest in the IPOs of VC-backed companies with sub-$100M in revenue. And, these companies are being valued highly enough so that VCs who invested early can make excellent returns. In many cases, these IPOs are &#8220;fund-makers&#8221; for the early stage VCs. And when they trade up in the aftermarket, it is a win-win for both VC and public market investors.</p>
<p>Of course, Linkedin, Groupon, and Zynga are absolutely phenomenal for the VCs involved. I wish I had been an early stage investor in any or all of these. And, they have proved to LPs that VCs can, once again, generate serious returns for them. But, just like Google didn&#8217;t ignite a rush of IPOs starting after 2004, I don&#8217;t think the sexy IPOs will launch a huge wave of IPOs. Why not? First, there just aren&#8217;t enough companies at that scale to expect VCs to have a consistent inventory of them. Second, several of these companies have gone public too late in their growth cycles to generate good long-term returns for public investors (my opinion). So, public investors may not be clamoring for more of them.</p>
<p>So, why are SaaS companies so attractive to public market investors and trading up in the aftermarket? I asked that question of a friend at a hedge fund that invests in IPOs. Here is his response (I bolded what I believe are his key points):</p>
<ul>
<li>SaaS companies are driven less by media hype and more by the investor appetite for attractive recurring revenue business models offered by the SaaS platform.</li>
<li>These companies are growing rapidly as a result of customers shifting functions away from in-house solutions to more flexible and enhanced platforms that help increase revenues, improve productivity and reduce costs.</li>
<li>Investors are not concerned by the lack of GAAP earnings, because there is a comfort driven by the 90-95% customer retention rates and an understanding that investing capital back in the business makes sense during the early phase of adoption.</li>
<li>These factors lead to more defensible businesses that make for attractive takeout candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, he is reiterating what Bill Gurley noted in his excellent post about what constitutes high quality revenue. In this case, SaaS companies solve critical problems for enterprises and generate sustainable and predictable recurring revenue with rapid growth.</p>
<p>The good news for the VC industry is that we have significant inventory of companies that fit this profile ($50-100M revenue and rapid growth). For example, companies like <a href="http://www.demandware.com/">Demandware</a>, <a href="http://box.com/">Box.net</a>, <a href="http://www.workday.com/">Workday</a>, <a href="http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a>, <a href="http://www.badgeville.com/">Badgeville</a>, <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">GetSatisfaction</a> and <a href="http://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a> should all reach critical mass in the next 12-24 months. And, there are many others.</p>
<p>I know from experience because my firm, <a href="http://www.interwest.com/">InterWest</a>, is an early investor in several companies in this category including Marketo, GetSatisfaction, Spredfast, Varolii, Cloud9, Aria Systems and Cubetree (acquired by Successfactors). These businesses take time to build and require experienced leaders to grow them. Not incidentally, we believe they also require patient VCs that are laser focused on this business model.</p>

<p>Right now the enterprise software space is growing rapidly, but so are the number of users who need it, especially freelancers, independent contractors, consultants, and developers. That said, companies who provide services like time-tracking need to evolve in order to meet the growing demands of their users. </p>

<p>The service, which launched as a web app, has gone on to be available on both iOS and Android, and most recently, as <a href="http://www.getHarvest.com/mac">a Mac desktop app</a>. Wen told us about how 7 percent of the Harvest user base has already downloaded the app on a Mac.</p>
<p>Wen and I also chatted out what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur without any funding. Harvest was entirely self-funded, and has seemed to weather the storm for the past six years. So if anyone&#8217;s should be shelling out advice, Den&#8217;s the one to do it. </p>

While most recognized the danger of that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/01/kill-switch/">irresponsible and short-sighted bill</a> and took action against it, some companies supported it strongly and even testified to that effect in Congress.</p>
<p>GoDaddy was one of those companies, and while it later tried to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/23/godaddy-no-longer-supports-sopa/">undo</a> the damage its position had done (the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/23/godaddy-ceo-there-has-to-be-consensus-about-the-leadership-of-the-internet-community/">new CEO</a> seems a little more in touch), the Internet isn&#8217;t so good at forgetting or forgiving. Among the many, many sites that pledged to leave GoDaddy&#8217;s DNS service was Wikipedia, and after three months of work, <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/03/09/transfer-of-wikipedia-sites-from-godaddy-complete/">they&#8217;ve finally done so</a>.</p>
<p>Their new DNS provider will be <a href="http://www.markmonitor.com/">MarkMonitor</a>, with whom they were working already for other reasons. MarkMonitor specializes in brand protection and prevention of fraud and piracy; their services include monitoring of peer-to-peer networks and redirection of users away from potentially fraudulent sites. It&#8217;s likely that the Wikimedia foundation was using the company&#8217;s services to monitor and prevent fake Wikipedia sites, illegal uses of Wikimedia assets or tools, and so on. They also do DNS for &#8220;well over half the Fortune 100.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, not perhaps the sunshine-and-flowers solution people might have wanted for Wikipedia as an antidote to GoDaddy, but it mustn&#8217;t be forgotten that the Wikimedia Foundation runs one of the most popular and widely-accessed sites on the internet, and therefore necessarily one of the most vulnerable. Heavy duty partners are necessary to deliver and maintain the integrity of their content.</p>
<p>Wikipedia&#8217;s migration, and that of hundreds of other sites, should act as a warning to Internet companies that fail to heed the opinions of their customers. Cyber-activism may not do much to depose African warlords, but it can certainly have a real effect on virtual tyrants.</p>

<p>So what happened next? In the past 24 hours I&#8217;ve heard three different guys say something to the affect of, &#8220;She? She is worth a billion? Huh. I guess anyone can be worth a billion.&#8221; As soon as someone says that they are scratched off my list of people I want to spend time with. I only like to be around positive people who celebrate success.</p>
<p>I hold a Twitter Q&amp;A session every Thursday EST from 3:30-4:30. I answer every question asked. Then I expand further into a blog post. Then I&#8217;ve taken all the blog posts, expanded further with original material plus added material from questions asked me via email and I compiled the results into a book I just self-published called &#8220;FAQ ME&#8221;.</p>
<div id="attachment_515178" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 241px"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/FAQ-ME-ebook/dp/B007GQIF2G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331218902&amp;sr=1-1"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(click on cover to go to book page)</p></div>
<p>One of the questions asked this Thursday was, &#8220;What are my key takeaways from the Spanx woman being worth a billion and how can one replicate her success?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<p>First off, I’m amazed by her and I have been ever since I saw on the Donnie Deutsch show on CNBC about 5 years ago. I spoke to the producer of that show shortly after it aired and he told me it was the most popular show they ever had. I never heard of her before then.</p>
<p>I had no idea she is now considered a billionaire. It’s not as if she has a billion in cash, but the theory is that if she were to sell her company today it would sell for one billion.</p>
<p>My takeaways:</p>
<p>- <strong>Stay motivated.</strong> She was reading self-help books (specifically Wayne Dyer’s earlier books) and motivational books since she was sixteen years old. What’s a self-help book do? It tells you that part of the world around you exists because you “think” it to exist. Extreme example: if you are lying on the floor depressed all the time you won’t seize opportunities. If ever day you wake up and say, “what adventure will happen to me today?” then adventures will happen to you. So from an early age she trained herself to look for the opportunities in life. She trained herself for 10 years thinking that way before the idea of Spanx hit her.</p>
<p>- <strong>She was amazingly good at sales</strong>. She had to sell fax machines for Danka as one of her first jobs. Within a few years, by the time she was 25, she was the national sales trainer. People shy away from the word “salesman”. They think the process of selling is “dirty” in some way. But the only way to get anywhere is to come up with ideas and then have a strong ability to sell them. She had that ability. Here’s my own suggestions on how to be a better salesperson: <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/01/the-10-keys-to-selling-anything/">The 10 Keys to Selling Anything: </a></p>
<p>- <strong>She solved a huge problem for women.</strong> If you want to create $1 billion in value you need to find a problem that nobody solved. Right now, this second, there are about one million problems where if you solve it, someone else will say, “holy shit!  That&#8217;s so easy. Why didn’t I think about that?&#8221; And yet, these problems right now remain unsolved.</p>
<p>So what was the problem she “solved”? Pantyhose that didn’t have feet that also smoothed out a woman’s body underneath the dress. What does that mean? “Smoothed out”. 99% of woman complain about the “muffin top” that forms after the pantyhose ends and their stomach takes over. No problem said Sara. Here’s pantyhose that solves it. And she did it. Now woman look sexier. Not only was this a huge problem for women, it solved a pretty big issue for men as well! We like looking at sexy women.</p>

<p>- <strong>Prepare.</strong> How did she do it? She had never done anything in fashion before. So she spent every day at the library and the hosiery stores. She had a full time job but at night she researched every patent. She bought every type of pantyhose. She knew the entire industry. To succeed at something:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know every product in the industry</li>
<li>Know every patent</li>
<li>Try out all the products</li>
<li>Understand how the products are made</li>
<li>Make a product that YOU would use every single day. You can&#8217;t sell it if you, personlly, don&#8217;t LOVE it.</li>
</ul>
<p>- <strong>Cold Call.</strong> Someone asked me yesterday if I had any connections at a major children’s company so she would be able to sell an excellent set of children’s travel books to them. I think it’s a great idea. Why? Because I see my kids buy every book from this children’s company. It’s a doll company but they put out books like, “How to be a child of divorce” as an example (which both my kids, being children of divorce, have read thoroughly). So why not travel books? And this woman has already made a dozen travel books for kids ages 8-12, the exact age group for this children’s doll company. I know this woman is a good writer because my kid even did a book report on one of her books and loved it. So I know kids would love her travel books.</p>
<p>She wanted a connection in because she was afraid to cold call. But almost all sales are done through cold calling. If there’s a need, people will love to meet you. Cold call right now!</p>
<p>When I was trying to get people to use Stockpickr.com, a site I built in 2006-2007, I cold-called AOL, Yahoo, Google, Reuters, Forbes. Guess what? Everyone responded because I knew it was something they all needed and I had at least 2-5 meetings with each group and did deals of some sort or other with all of them. If you have something that’s worthwhile then you can’t be afraid to cold-call. They need you more than you need them.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with the Spanx woman? She cold-called the number one place to sell her stuff – Niemen Marcus, and they loved her product and took it right away.</p>
<p>- <strong>It doesn’t cost much to make a billion.</strong> She started with $5000. That’s it. She never took investors. She never borrowed money. Now her revenues are hundreds of millions a year.  Facebook spent a few thousand to get to the point where they had a million users a day. Google hardly spent any money at first. Not that I’m in the billion dollar league but I can tell you that Stockpickr.com cost me less than $5,000 to build and was sold for $10mm a few months later. And the first company I sold cost less than $0 to build. We had profitable clients from day one.</p>
<div id="attachment_515183" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 214px"><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/spanx2.jpg" rel="lightbox[515173]"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(Sara Blakely)</p></div>
<p>If you have an idea: don’t focus on the money. Don’t focus on how you will make a living. Do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build your product</li>
<li>Sell it to a customer</li>
<li>Start shipping</li>
<li><strong>Then</strong> quit your job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sara, the founder of Spanx, didn’t quit her job until she was already well on her way to selling her first million in orders. Most entrepreneurs write me before they have a product even built. They have &#8220;an idea&#8221; and they want to quit their job to pursue it so they need to raise money right now. Are you crazy? Anyone who would give you money might as well get really good with a plunger because they are going to need it after the money gets flushed down the toilet.</p>
<p>- <strong> Never ask Permission, Ask for Forgiveness Later.</strong> Sara didn’t like how Spanx were being displayed at Niemen Marcus. So she bought samples at Target and displayed them right next to the cash register at Niemen Marcus. She knew, innately, that nobody would question her. Nobody questions anything if you have confidence, intelligence, and you are proud of your product. So she just did it. To hell with the ramifications. What else did she do? She sent Spanx to Oprah Winfrey’s stylist. Who was more perfect to wear Spanx than Oprah Winfrey.</p>
<p>- <strong>Take advantage of all publicity</strong>.  I’m bad at this. I say “no” to almost everything. CNBC used to call me all the time and I wouldn’t even return their calls. Finally <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/10-things-i-learned-working-with-jim-cramer/">Jim Cramer said to me</a>, “Why are you embarassing me like this. Return their calls.” At this very moment I’m turning down an offer to speak at a TED conference. I just don’t feel like preparing for it. I’d rather blog to you guys. But Cramer made the very good point to me, “if you don’t promote yourself, nobody else will.”</p>
<p>I first heard about Spanx when she was on that Donnie Deutcsh show. But also millions heard about it through Oprah, an opportunity that Sara created for herself. And she also spent a season on Richard Branson’s reality show, defying every fear she ever had. She promoted herself down every avenue. That’s what you have to do to succeed. You can’t have any shame.  I see in myself that I have a lot of shame in promoting myself that I have to get over. She had no shame.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/spanx3.jpg" rel="lightbox[515173]"></a></p>
<p>- <strong>Looks.</strong> I’m not saying good looks or bad looks. But YOU are the best promoter of your product. So if your product is something in the fashion industry, you should make sure you are the best model for it. A good friend of mine is about to launch a skin cream for Latina women. The cream smoothes out wrinkles and also smoothes out the different shades of color on the face that many Latinas have. She’s about 40 years old. I can tell you this: she doesn’t have a single wrinkle and her skin glows. She will be the best model for her product.</p>
<p>Again, you don’t have to be great looking. I’m a weird, geekish looking guy. Who better to sell a website? Or website services in the 90s like I used to. If I looked like a J. Crew model I might’ve failed. Instead I had the look of a dirty computer genius (even though I was thrown out of computer science grad school) and I can tell you – that look worked for me.</p>
<p>- <strong>Good for her.</strong> Don&#8217;t be a hater! 99% of people are haters.</p>
<p>If you want to be successful, you need to study success, not hate it or be envious of it. <strong>If you are envious, then you will distance yourself from success and make it that much harder to get there</strong>. Never be jealous. Never think someone is “lucky”. Luck is created by the prepared. Never think that someone is undeserving of the money they have. That only puts you one more step removed from the freedom you aspire to. I can tell right away when someone is so envious and jealous that they will never get the freedom they want and will spend the rest of their life trying.</p>
<p>- <strong>It’s not about the money.</strong> In the article I just read about her it tells a story of how she had to tell her fiancé a few weeks before their wedding that Spanx wasn’t just selling a few million dollars worth a year but hundreds of millions of dollars worth a year.</p>
<p>That’s a big difference, right? And it was only a few weeks before their wedding. Why didn’t he already know? She probably never spoke about it. You know why? Because she probably didn’t care about the money.</p>
<p>In the past fifteen years the only time I didn’t look at my bank account every day was when I was doing something I was passionate about. She was clearly passionate about Spanx. The money quickly became an afterthought.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think about money. But it does mean if YOU ARE thinking too much about money while building your business then either you are not very passionate about the business or you aren’t helping people with your business. Those two thoughts alone will crowd at the thoughts of your own personal bank account.</p>
<p>What a pleasure that is when you experience it and it doesn&#8217;t matter if you are rich or poor. It doesn&#8217;t matter because you are not even thinking about the money.  You KNOW you are creating value. <strong>The money is just a side effect of passion.</strong></p>
<p>My final takeaway. God bless her. She’s worth a billion.</p>

Mobli, which counts Leonardo DiCaprio as one of its investors (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/25/leo-dicaprio-gets-in-on-celebrity-tech-investing-leads-4m-round-in-photo-sharing-app-mobli/">$4M funding to date</a>), is dubbing the new version, 'Mobli 2.0'. Personally I feel they should have gone with 'The <em>New</em> Mobli' &#8212; zing! 

Besides a Pinterest-inspired interface, the new version packs a major upgrade to the camera, along with a set of features to edit, touch-up and enhance photos, all bundled under a new section in the app called, 'Darkroom'. 

Rebuilt from the ground up, the new camera now includes real-time tilt-shift and even real-time video filters. Focus can now be locked and white balance set. This is on top of the 18 brand-new photo filters, superimposed gridlines and a self-timer.

Personally I feel they should have gone with &#8216;The <em>New</em> Mobli&#8217; &mdash; zing! </p>
<p>Besides a Pinterest-inspired interface, the new version packs a major upgrade to the camera, along with a set of features to edit, touch-up and enhance photos, all bundled under a new section in the app called, &#8216;Darkroom&#8217;. </p>

<p>The more significant part of this update is the Darkroom, which users can enter after they take a shot. Photos can be beautified with auto-correction for lighting and skin detail. A &#8216;Hawkeye&#8217; button is an instant color and contrast enhancement feature, and there are now 9 more frames. </p>
<p>One of my favorite things about Mobli is its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/08/mobli-filters/">context and location-based features</a>. In drunken honor of SXSW, Mobli will feature one exclusively available for folks in Austin (see screenshot below).</p>
<p>And if photos don&#8217;t express enough words for you, Mobli also built in a new messaging system into the app version 2.0</p>
<p>All-in-all, Mobli 2.0 is like Instagram on crack. Some may hate it, others will get hooked.</p>

He may have <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/16/last-post/">told me off</a> not so long ago, despite my <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/22/you-can-block-any-facebook-user-except-mark-zuckerberg/">fine work</a> <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/110912/p29#a110912p29">here</a> over the years. But, we&#8217;ve talked it out and patched things up. You know how things go with bloggers.</p>
<p>Anyway, Paul is also in Austin right now, launching the US edition of his book &#8216;<a href="http://www.bookpeople.com/event/paul-carr-upgrade">The Upgrade: A Cautionary Tale of a Life Without Reservations.</a>&#8216; He&#8217;s doing a reading this afternoon at 5 pm <a href="http://www.bookpeople.com/event/paul-carr-upgrade">at Bookpeople</a>, (603 N. Lamar, Austin, Tx). I&#8217;ll be there, and apparently some &#8216;characters&#8217; from the book are going to be in the audience too. Also, as Paul <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/paulcarr/status/177461971111772160">tweeted</a> a few days ago… I&#8217;m going to spare you the embed, actually. Let&#8217;s just say the guy is shameless.</p>
<p>The book, for the uninitiated, tells the story of how he gave up his crappy life in London and decided to live as a permanent hotel-based nomad. I&#8217;ll let the back cover speak for itself:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Thanks to Paul&#8217;s ability to talk his way into increasingly ridiculous situations, what begins as a one-year experiment soon becomes a permanent lifestyle &#8212; a life lived in luxury hotels and mountain-top villas. A life of fast cars, Hollywood actresses and Icelandic rock stars. And, most bizarrely of all, a life that still costs less than his surviving on cold pizza in his old apartment. Yet, as word of Paul&#8217;s exploits starts to spread &#8212; first online, then through a national newspaper column and eventually a book deal &#8212; he finds himself forced constantly to up the stakes in order to keep things interesting. With his behavior spiraling to dangerous &#8212; and sometimes criminal &#8212; levels, he is forced to ask the question: is there such a thing as too much freedom?</em></p>
<p>The saga includes Paul&#8217;s first visit to TechCrunch 50, his meeting Sarah Lacy and Michael Arrington and subsequent adventures with both of them. It also includes the time he was mean about Le Web and a whole bunch of stuff about South By Southwest that he doesn&#8217;t like to talk about now. But maybe he will at the reading?</p>
<p>For those of you who can&#8217;t make it &#8212; which, to remind you, is today at 5pm at Bookpeople &#8212; Paul has shown his characteristic generosity in offering TechCrunch a staggering six copies of The Upgrade to give away to readers. To win a copy, simply tell him in the comments why you deserve one. He&#8217;ll pick the best six next week.</p>
<p>Ok, see you at Bookpeople.</p>

I never dreamed that I'd have a legitimate excuse to write a TechCrunch post about Joseph Kony, the crazed Ugandan warlord whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Resistance_Army">Lord's Resistance Army</a> has been a pet obsession of mine for some years now. The first draft of <a href="http://rezendi.com/nightOfKnives.htm">my thriller set mostly in Uganda and the Congo</a> had a villain loosely based on Kony, but I had to edit him out, basically because he's far too batshit crazy to be even remotely believable. The world is surprisingly full of things so implausible they would never fly in fiction, and the LRA is one of them.

Now, stretching credulity even further, a 30-minute-long LRA-awareness video from the quasi-NGO <em>Invisible Children</em> has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/07/stop-joseph-kony/">gone viral</a> around the world. Celebrities and A-listers everywhere are retweeting it. Of course! Because if we just increase worldwide public awareness of the LRA's horrific depredations, why, then...

...and that's where they lose me. What exactly are Invisible Children hoping to accomplish with this? They <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/joseph-kony-invisible-children_n_1326759.html">claim credit</a> for persuading Obama to send 100 US troops in October to help the Ugandan army find the LRA; but for what it's worth, I happen to know that the US Army was interested in tracking down Kony well before that. (How? Last June, while <a href="techcrunch.com/2011/06/07/this-is-where-the-magic-happens/">roaming around East Africa</a>, I went <a href="http://blog.rezendi.com/2011/06/world-is-salt.html">diving in Djibouti with some Special Forces dudes</a>--as you do--and Kony came up in conversation.)

Raise your hands: who here seriously thinks the Special Forces will be any more effective because <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/invisible-children-in-the-spotlight/article2362416/">Taylor Swift, Diddy, Rihanna, and Zooey Deschanel</a> are tweeting their moral support?]]></description>

<p>&#8230;and that&#8217;s where they lose me. What exactly are Invisible Children hoping to accomplish with this? They <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/joseph-kony-invisible-children_n_1326759.html">claim credit</a> for persuading Obama to send 100 US troops in October to help the Ugandan army find the LRA; but for what it&#8217;s worth, I happen to know that the US Army was interested in tracking down Kony well before that.

<p>Raise your hands: who here seriously thinks the Special Forces will be any more effective because <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/invisible-children-in-the-spotlight/article2362416/">Taylor Swift, Diddy, Rihanna, and Zooey Deschanel</a> are tweeting their moral support? Exactly how deluded do you have to be to think that &#8220;public awareness&#8221; will solve a grim and deadly military problem? Remember a few years ago when the Twittersphere got all irate about Iran&#8217;s disputed election, and everyone set their location to Tehran to &#8220;help the resistance,&#8221; as if a posse of faraway microbloggers might help take down a totalitarian government? Have we learned nothing?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;ve said <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/13/the-end-of-history-part-ii/">time and time again</a> that technology, especially social media, can overthrow governments and change the world in fundamental ways. But only if it&#8217;s synchronized with actual on-the-ground action. What good is &#8220;public awareness&#8221; going to do to hunt down a gang of crazed psychopaths wandering around one of the last effectively lawless regions in the world, the vast anarchic northeastern Congo? (No, not Uganda &#8211; Kony fled from there <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/07/guest_post_joseph_kony_is_not_in_uganda_and_other_complicated_things">six years ago</a>.)</p>
<p>Aside from &#8220;raising public awareness&#8221;, Invisible Children wants to raise money to pay for an early-warning radio network that will warn villagers if the LRA is nearby. (That is, whatever&#8217;s left over <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/qkxvm/kony_2012/c3yfvii">after they pay themselves</a> &#8212; millions in salary and over $1 million on travel last year.)</p>
<p>That part may actually sound like a good idea &#8230; until you realize we&#8217;re talking about distributing equipment to thousands of tiny habitations in an area bigger than France with almost no infrastructure whatsoever, all essentially to spread <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a>, because even if you <i>do</i> successfully warn people that the LRA is nearby, there&#8217;s not a lot they can do about it. It&#8217;s completely impractical verging on absurd, which may explain why their <a href="http://invisible.tumblr.com/post/18929372614/thank-you-for-reading-this-and-doing-further">list of actual accomplishments</a> is so anorexically thin, despite that million dollars spent on travel&#8230;</p>
<p>Wait, no, it&#8217;s OK: they have an app! The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lra-crisis-tracker/id473115064&amp;mt=8">LRA Crisis Tracker</a> &#8220;gives real-time updates of atrocities committed by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army in Central Africa.&#8221; Because, you know, iPhones are ubiquitous in the remote Congolese and Central African Republic regions haunted by the LRA. But who cares about <em>them</em>? The important thing is that <em>you</em> can download the app and somehow feel <em>connected</em> to their plight. Like you&#8217;re making a difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;A perfect illustration of the good that can be accomplished with evolving technology,&#8221; says a review on the App Store. That person is smoking crack. Look, I am a huge, huge, <i>huge</i> champion of technology in the developing world and its ever-growing ability to revolutionize people&#8217;s lives for the better. I give you <a href="techcrunch.com/2011/06/07/this-is-where-the-magic-happens/">this</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/13/and-now-for-some-unexpectedly-good-news/">this</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/02/the-phoenix-and-the-dragon/">this</a>, <a href="techcrunch.com/2011/07/10/power-to-the-people/">this</a>, and <a href="techcrunch.com/2010/12/31/future/">this</a> as evidence. But this Invisible Children crap&#8211;wholly aside from the <a href="http://thedisorderofthings.com/2012/03/08/can-i-tell-you-the-bad-guys-name-a-virtual-read-in-and-comment-on-kony2012-and-badvocacy/">many, many questions raised about that organization</a>&#8211;is meaningless feel-good armchair activism at its worst.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s without even beginning to consider the whole insulting, paternalistic &#8220;Africans are helpless and doomed, as ever! Only we rich Americans and Europeans can save them!&#8221; subtext. (Meanwhile, in the real world, over the last decade, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21541015">six of the world&#8217;s ten fastest-growing economies</a> were in sub-Saharan Africa.)</p>
<p>But if all this still somehow strikes a colonial chord in your heart, and you feel like you need to <a href="http://9gag.com/gag/3212157">do something</a> &#8212; do me a favor? Give to <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/donate/overview.cfm?ref=main-menu">Doctors Without Borders</a>, who go to the toughest, grimmest places in the world, where they do astonishing, lifesaving disaster-relief work, with their eyes wide open to the limitations and compromises of their context. And please don&#8217;t pretend that &#8220;raising public awareness&#8221; has anything to do with actual solutions.</p>

Most people who know me say I’m too diplomatic, but last week my advisor told me that someone asked him if I was “difficult”.  His answer was “if Ash was difficult, I wouldn’t work with him." I was going to write something on the matter, but felt that doing so would make me come across as, you know, difficult.

But after a recent brief discussion this week with a fellow executive ended in disagreement, I thought to myself: “well that guy’s definitely going to think I’m difficult”, even though only a fool would have accepted his offer.

It reminded me of that Chris Rock line: “What’s sexual harassment? When an ugly guy wants to get some?" Well, what's being difficult? When someone doesn't give you what you want?]]></description>

<p>The greatest entrepreneurs follow their gut and as a result are perceived as difficult at best and abrasive at worst.</p>
<p>Most people who know me say I’m too diplomatic, but last week my advisor told me that someone asked him if I was “difficult”.  His answer was “if Ash was difficult, I wouldn’t work with him.&#8221; I was going to write something on the matter, but felt that doing so would make me come across as, you know, difficult.</p>
<p>But after a recent brief discussion this week with a fellow executive ended in disagreement, I thought to myself: “well <em>that</em> guy’s definitely going to think I’m difficult”, even though only a fool would have accepted his offer.</p>
<p>It reminded me of that <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/96/96emono.phtml">Chris Rock line</a>: <em>“What’s sexual harassment? When an ugly guy wants to get some?</em>&#8221; Well, what&#8217;s being difficult? When someone doesn&#8217;t give you what you want?</p>
<p><strong>A Different Kind of 1%</strong></p>
<p>Even if 99% of people think you’re reasonable, there will always be the 1% that thinks you’re difficult.  Personally, in my situation, it boils down to being a self-funded, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/07/why-bootstrapping-over-rated/">bootstrapped</a> founder who’s the company “CXO”, wearing many hats and not having the luxury of having a fellow C-level executive come in afterwards to play the bad cop. Ultimately, I have to deliver on my word, so occasionally this means I won’t say or do what someone may wish.  This avoids larger problems down the road.</p>
<p><strong>Equity Means Ownership to Others; Control to Entrepreneurs</strong></p>
<p>There’s a fine line between being assertive and an ass.  We’ve already touched on how you can <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/25/how-to-get-people-to-do-what-you-want/">get others to do what you want</a>.  This article isn’t about management of employees, it’s about negotiations with outsiders and others thinking you’re difficult when</p>
<p>i)                    you don’t offer them what they want and/or<br />
ii)                   you don’t accept what they offer.</p>
<p>That might make you come across as difficult to them, but that really says more about them than you.</p>
<p>My philosophy on negotiations echoes Time Warner’s Dick Parsons: “When you negotiate, leave a little something on the table”, otherwise no one would want to deal with you in the future  In fact, I try to avoid saying “I’m being reasonable”, because everyone thinks they’re reasonable: it’s more important how others perceive you in your wheeling and dealings.</p>
<p>There’s way too much envy and jealousy in the world and our industry, so part of what makes critics think that entrepreneurs are difficult stems from that, though no one will admit it. No one is “driven by money” until they realize that someone is about to make money or has made money, at which point everyone inherits a sense of entitlement.</p>
<p><strong>Control vs. Stability: Missionary vs. Mercenary Mindsets</strong></p>
<p>While founders seek missionaries (in a secular sense) to join their cause, they tend to draw mercenaries. Despite the high failure rate of startups, the perception of overnight success and quick riches is high to those driven by money.</p>
<p>As such, to the founder, equity means control and the ability to prioritize the stakeholders’ needs and wants according to his moral compass.  To the recruits, ownership rarely means control (since they have minority stakes) but rather, possible wealth.</p>
<p>The following nuance is key in both understanding and reacting to claims you’re being difficult: managers and employees usually get equity as a bonus and incentive for joining a fledging startup; whereas investors are getting equity in exchange for an investment.</p>
<p><strong>Not All Stakeholders Are Created Equally</strong></p>
<p>However, oftentimes you’re accused of being difficult by would-be investors and future employees. Their feedback may be really valuable and to some extent correct, but it’s impossible to please everyone, especially if the majority don&#8217;t view you as difficult to begin with.</p>
<p>While it’s important for your clients and employees not to think you’re difficult; it’s actually not the end of the world for your investors, board, competitors and even your suppliers to think that you’re at least a little bit difficult.  If dealing with you is akin to taking candy from a baby, you’re doing something wrong and will end up like the founder who had 0.5 percent of his company after five years.</p>
<p>In fact, to please some stakeholders, you <em>need</em> to resist others; that might make you seem difficult to narrow-minded stakeholders that don’t like your position on a matter, but it absolutely makes you a better <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/04/mark-zuckerbergs-6-ingredients-for-success/">leader</a> over time.</p>
<p>To some, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfMThCSmQ6Y">Mark Zuckerberg</a> wasn’t being reasonable when he turned down offers from Yahoo, Google or Viacom early on, but in hindsight, everyone that doubted him then supports him now.</p>
<p>So it’s not the end of the world if would-be advisors and investors think you’re tough, because there’s actually a very weak chance they’re really <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/03/what-a-love-doctor-taught-me-about-fundraising/">interested</a> anyway (especially since sometimes would-be investors want you to upset your existing investors).  You’re building the company so the best investors and advisors are the ones who understand and support you.</p>
<p>I’m not saying to go to ignore feedback or become abrasive, but to quote football coach Steve Spurrier: “If people like you too much, it&#8217;s probably because they&#8217;re beating you.”</p>
<p><strong>The Irony of Honesty</strong></p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs eventually drown self-doubt out through naïveté, idealism and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/04/mark-zuckerbergs-6-ingredients-for-success/">determination</a>, which spills over into how we communicate our vision and rationalize criticism.  Ultimately, people appreciate candor until you’re forthright with them, at which point you’re impolite.</p>
<p>As impossible as it seems, if you can leave your emotion aside when people give you feedback and choose your spots when it comes to dishing out the criticism, then you’ll become a very effective leader.</p>
<p><strong>The Hypocrisy of Time</strong></p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are always told that “time is the most precious asset”. Perhaps. But when we cut to the chase and pass on an idea or offer, we’re sometimes told we’re difficult, even though the greatest skill an entrepreneur has is listening to his gut.</p>
<p><strong>The Double Standard of Being Difficult</strong></p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, it seems that everyone goes out of their way to be difficult with you.  Now it&#8217;s the entrepreneur&#8217;s turn to get over it, no one forced you to lead this life.</p>
<p>In the end, a little bit of understanding of the other person&#8217;s situation and background would help everyone be, well, less difficult.</p>

As a book lover, I view e-readers as interlopers; as a practical person, I acknowledge them as inevitable. But in both cases, I have come to view them as a deeply unsatisfying reading experience.

I mean, I&#8217;ve used them enough to know a good one from a bad one, to understand the features, and to do a proper evaluation — but I&#8217;ve never made one part of my life, the way one makes a mobile phone or laptop part of one&#8217;s life. In that way I haven&#8217;t <em>really</em> used an e-reader. Until just recently.</p>
<p>As a book lover, I view e-readers as interlopers; as a practical person, I acknowledge them as inevitable. But in both cases, I have come to view them as a deeply unsatisfying reading experience. They fall short of paper in meaningful ways, and objecting to them should not be considered technophobic.</p>
<p>The future of e-books is bright, but as far as I&#8217;m concerned, right now we&#8217;re still in the dark age &mdash; though that isn&#8217;t to say the stone age.</p>
<p>The core experience of the new Kindle, Nook, and Kobo (pictured) is practically the same. Sure, there are aesthetic differences and the selection is different, but when you&#8217;re doing what the devices are intended to do — reading a book, page by page — they are nearly identical.</p>
<p>Now I expect the PR departments have already started composing a new email with their talking points about how their device is the best, but let&#8217;s be realistic. These guys are using almost exactly the same parts (the most important bit, the screen, is the same in all three) and if you took the logos off the devices, few people would be able to tell you which is which or express a strong preference.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t say this to denigrate the devices. This generation of e-readers is the most user-friendly and practical by far. But aside from the change to a touchscreen, e-readers have barely advanced from the day they were first introduced. So when I say I prefer paper, that&#8217;s not sentimentality. Paper really is just better.</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m not putting you on or trying to play the devil&#8217;s advocate. But I&#8217;m willing to make a few concessions first. Obviously e-readers are better in a few ways: the wireless in the Kindle which allows you to get books almost wherever you are, for instance. And you can certainly keep more books on one device than you can keep in your carry-on. But that&#8217;s pretty much where the benefits end, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/jackal.jpg" rel="lightbox[515136]"></a></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><small><em>Text can be pixelated or low-contrast</em></small></div>
<p>The screens aren&#8217;t actually that good. You can admit it, it&#8217;s okay. Even the newest ones. They&#8217;re rather grey, and the text doesn&#8217;t <em>really</em> look that good, does it? They&#8217;re a bit small, too. Don&#8217;t you feel it&#8217;s a bit limiting? You can&#8217;t replace a newspaper with this thing, and images look pretty bad. That blinking thing when it refreshes itself is annoying, finding a particular chapter or passage can be a pain, and lending or borrowing books isn&#8217;t as straightforward as it could be.</p>
<p>Am I just being an entitled consumer? A bit, yes. But there&#8217;s a good reason for my (mild and proportionate) frustration. The makers of e-readers have made a conscious choice over the last two years or so: provide the same product at a lower price, not a better product at the same price. It&#8217;s not that I have a problem with this. I wrote two years ago (http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/24/dirt-cheap-and-no-features-to-speak-of-will-the-kobo-e-reader-sell-by-the-million/) that this was the end game for the current players. That&#8217;s only an issue if, like me, the initial devices held no interest. For many, the race to the bottom was a good thing, making the basic e-reading experience possible for an extremely low price (and getting lower year by year). This is already having serious effects on the publishing and education ecosystems.</p>
<p>But what you see is also the inevitable result of companies relying on a dwindling pool of OEMs capable of manufacturing parts in the millions. The leading devices all use the same third-generation E-Ink display; few people would notice differences between the way they handle text, or care either way. As I mentioned, there are differences in the interface outside of books, and in how you search and buy, that sort of thing, but the purpose of these devices is <em>to display e-books</em>, and they all do it without appreciable differences.</p>
<p>Now, when their products are the same, companies compete on bullshit. We saw this in the 90s when every Compaq, HP, Dell, and Gateway PC was using the same pieces, and we see it today with TV makers who all have the same fundamental features and have to invent new numbers to increment at every CES. Markets at this stage are ripe to be broken into, as Apple is fond of doing. This point is when it often steps into the picture. I don&#8217;t mean to imply Apple will enter the e-reader wars (in fact, the iPad is their entry in a way), but <em>someone</em> is going to have to change the game. Selling a commodity, which is what e-readers have become, is a dangerous business in tech, because commodities tend to devalue rather quickly.</p>
<p>What needs to happen? A superior product, that&#8217;s all. E-readers can&#8217;t remain dumb, paperback-sized, text display gadgets forever. If they&#8217;re going to replace books, and paper, they need to learn a few more tricks.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/books.jpg" rel="lightbox[515136]"></a></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><small><em>Browsing your &#8220;library&#8221; is slow and lacks discoverability; organization isn&#8217;t organic</em></small></div>
<p>It&#8217;ll take some time; no one wants to obsolete their own product, and these readers are setting up what is potentially a very profitable ecosystem. But at the same time, if <em>they</em> don&#8217;t do it, someone else might. Leave your lunch out too long and someone might just eat it for you. So you better believe that the big guys are planning <em>real</em> replacements for the e-reader of today, and are on the lookout for any sign that they might get beaten to the punch.</p>
<p>What will the new features be? Well, for example, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/18/aerobee-bridgeston/">Bridgestone</a> has produced a screen that appears to beat E-Ink at every level. And half the electronic companies out there are hard at work on flexible OLED or bistable displays. Sony is testing the waters with a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/13/hands-on-with-the-sony-s1-and-s2/">foldable tablet</a>, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/06/readius-foldable-e-reader-to-be-resurrected/">Readius</a> has been flogging their flexible device for a while now. E Ink, conscious that they&#8217;ll have to make serious advances in order to keep their position as head bistable display honcho, is making screens that can be <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/04/e-ink-shows-off-more-flexible-crunchable-screens/">crumpled or attached to cloth</a>. Color e-paper is shipping right now, though it&#8217;s not particularly good. Don&#8217;t expect the e-readers of tomorrow to be the same static window on text that they are today.</p>
<p>The screen quality, too, is going to have to improve. In both resolution and contrast, e-readers need to approach print on paper, or they will forever be understood as being a sub-par option, grey and indistinct. More comfortable to read on than LCDs, sure, but for how long? The advantage of the reflective display will eventually be outweighed by other factors if they don&#8217;t start moving.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll want to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/11/in-defense-of-the-stylus/">write on them</a>, too. The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/04/noteslate-a-simple-e-paper-device-that-may-or-may-not-exist/">Noteslate</a> device, unfortunately totally fictional (but apparently now in the works), awakened a sleeping giant of gadget envy on the net. Who <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want one of those things? Yet none of the major e-reading devices are even attempting it.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/highlight.jpg" rel="lightbox[515136]"></a></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><small><em>Annotating and highlighting content is clumsy and slow</em></small></div>
<p>What else? Social and collaborative features, no doubt, like those just beginning to be promoted; more portability and ruggedness; features to enable reading by the blind, like quality real-time text-to-speech and tactile displays; richer formatting and rendering; self-illuminating screens or text; adjustable page tint; to say all, anything you can imagine might improve the reading experience, and probably a few things you haven&#8217;t imagined yet.</p>
<p>These fantasy devices don&#8217;t have to beat paper at <em>everything</em> &mdash; after all, they&#8217;ll never beat it on battery life &mdash; it&#8217;s just a little disappointing in how few ways they better their venerable competitor. And note that the e-reader should be considered distinct from the tablet (which, though more versatile, shares many shortcomings) as a device aimed specifically at consuming and storing text, and mostly black and white text at that. I suspect that factor will remain important for years to come.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s not as if e-reader makers have been standing still all this time. Their devices are lighter, brighter, and faster, and making the screens touchable was a good move. But the problem is that after all these improvements, e-readers&#8217; advantages over books still aren&#8217;t very significant. If you read one or two books at a time, and not big ones, the advantage is almost nil. E-readers should be <em>way</em> better than books! The possibility is there; the technology is there; the demand is there. There are dozens of things we would like to be able to do with our literature, our journals, our newspapers, that are inconvenient or impossible with existing form factors (paper, tablet, PC, or other). E-readers have a world to expand into, yet they are exploring it at a snail&#8217;s pace.</p>
<p>Why whine about this? Think back on the last ten years. How many tablets and MIDs do you spy with your little Internet eye? Dozens, most of them failures or niche products. Because, really, they simply weren&#8217;t good enough. E-readers have caught on to some extent, more so than the early tablets and MIDs certainly, but I would suggest that this is because of a pent-up demand for a device like this and not because of any particular fitness on its part. At the moment, they&#8217;re still quite crude, really — and we only tolerate their crudeness because right now convenience is valued over utility.</p>
<p>No one would blame you for not buying a Palm Pilot or Newton or early MID back in the day, because although they did have a purpose, they were, even at the time, clearly not mature products. E-readers aren&#8217;t mature either; don&#8217;t be fooled by the homogeneity of today&#8217;s options. They&#8217;re like that because of the decision they made, to drop prices instead of change the product. Just because they look alike and act alike doesn&#8217;t mean they are mature, the way PCs became mature in the late 90s.</p>
<p>These early devices ape semi-convincingly the experience of reading a book. Is that the end game? No. Should you expect something better? Yes. Should that stop you from buying one right now? Maybe.</p>
<p>For me, buying the most advanced e-reader today involves too many compromises in quality. The ways in which I read and interact with my books are simply incompatible with e-readers as they exist today. So I don&#8217;t buy, though in five years their successors will have me reaching for my wallet. It&#8217;s like seeing Microsoft showing off a tablet in the early 2000s. Did I want a tablet? Sure, ever since I first saw one &mdash; probably in <em>Star Trek</em>. But I didn&#8217;t try to buy that one, because it&#8217;s okay to say that something isn&#8217;t good enough for you. That&#8217;s the prerogative of the consumer. I don&#8217;t want a Kindle &#8211; I want what the Kindle will become, just as I wanted what the Treo and Newton would become. There&#8217;s no shame, and maybe even a little dignity, in waiting.</p>
<p>I love books. I love reading. And I love technology. But I can&#8217;t bring myself to even like today&#8217;s e-readers, except as promising indicators of things to come. For now, between paper and plastic, there&#8217;s no contest.</p>

The Army has therefore <a href="http://www.army.mil/article/75165/Geotagging_poses_security_risks/">published an article</a> calling attention to this fact, though its casual tone suggests that they aren't ready to take serious action on the issue.

In 2007, geotagged photos of a new fleet of helicopters allowed enemy forces to mortar the base and destroy several of them; it could just as easily have been a field hospital or barracks.</p>
<p>The Army has therefore <a href="http://www.army.mil/article/75165/Geotagging_poses_security_risks/">published an article</a> calling attention to this fact, though its casual tone suggests that they aren&#8217;t ready to take serious action on the issue. A warning is all it is, and perhaps also an acknowledgement that sometimes it&#8217;s better to bend with the breeze than fight it.</p>
<p>While soldiers in the field aren&#8217;t likely to be checking in to engagements or taking pictures of their fortifications for the kids, such things are still going to happen. Whether it&#8217;s enlisted personnel or people like embedded journalists, DoD researchers, civilian contractors, or what have you, the risk of someone posting sensitive information is real. And with the speed of sharing today, such data can propagate rapidly enough that it&#8217;s a serious security risk.</p>
<p>The army&#8217;s power to control the devices used by its soldiers and those around them is limited. And any attempt at locational lockdown would almost certainly end in failure. Luckily, it can still minimize the risk by making social media part of a soldier&#8217;s situational awareness. It&#8217;s a testament to the power and reach of social media that it should be entered into tactical calculations.</p>
<p>And while location sharing is framed primarily as a risk today, it&#8217;s obvious from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/03/u-s-government-military-to-get-secret-worthy-android-phones/">the military&#8217;s pursuit of smartphones</a> as an integral part of a soldier&#8217;s equipment that they value it as a potential asset as well.</p>

<p>Net income for the year was $9.7 million, up 21 percent from 2010&#8242;s net income of $8 million For the fourth quarter, Kayak saw a 27 percent increase in quarterly revenue, posting $53.9 million in Q4 2011 sales.

<p>But the company says that typically its highest revenue quarters are the second and third quarters.</p>
<p>Kayak says it finished 2011 with 899 million user queries processes for travel information, representing growth of 42 percent from 2010. For 2011, Kayak had 7 million downloads, up over 70 percent from 2010.</p>
<p>Despite the IPO being on hold, Kayak has been consistently trying to improve its core product and add additional functionality.

And the search engine just <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/08/kayak-expands-direct-booking-into-flights-adds-jetsetter-and-travel-leisure-hotel-reviews/">debuted direct booking</a> for flights.</p>

<p>Cater2.me was founded in late 2010 and has already attracted some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/technology/internet/lunch-catered-by-internet-middlemen.html">positive press attention</a>. Now, its client list includes some startups worth bragging about, such as Yelp, Eventbrite, Tagged, Square, Dropbox, Twilio, Causes, Posterous, and Heyzap. The company is serving 40,000 lunches a month (including many to non-startups, of course.)</p>
<p>Co-founders Alex Lorton and Zach Yungst are both graduates from the Wharton Business School and before starting Cater2.me, both worked finance/consulting jobs in downtown San Francisco. They saw it was their time in those offices that convinced them of the opportunity. Outside, they saw a vibrant culinary world of hole-in-the-wall ethnic restaurants, food carts, and farmers markets. Inside, bland catered food.</p>
<p>So Cater2.me tries to bring that varied world of food into workplaces. Office managers, or whoever else is in charge of a company&#8217;s meals, can just go to the Cater2.me website and enter their needs — for example, if they need to feed 50 people every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and five of them are vegetarians. Then Cater2.me handles all of the logistics, bringing in a rotating menu of food from a network of small restaurants and carts — businesses that probably don&#8217;t have the time or resources to do large office catering on their own.</p>
<p>Eventbrite&#8217;s Brooke Michael says she started testing Cater2.me as a lunch option back in June 2011. Over time, she did more and more ordering for them, because the process was so easy and the company was so responsive to customer feedback. Now Eventbrite is even relying on the service for its breakfasts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, they have really improved our meals at Eventbrite and have brought a lot of smiles to our employees,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>This market seems to be catching the interest of investors, too. Two other catering services, Eat Club and Zero Cater, <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120215/at-silicon-valley-companies-theres-certainly-such-a-thing-as-a-free-lunch-for-employees/">both raised $1.5 million in venture capital</a> recently. (Eat Club reportedly served 60,000 lunches in the past year.) Cater2.me, however, remains self-funded.</p>

That's why startup <a href="http://www.mobcaster.com">Mobcaster</a> has launched a new platform where creators can ask fans directly for the financial support needed to produce their shows.

The startup just had its first funding success story — <em><a href="http://mobcaster.com/project/the-weatherman">The Weatherman</a></em>, an Australian-produced comedy about, yes, a weatherman, which just raised the funding for its first season. The production company set a goal of $72,500, and it raised $73,975. (As the team notes at the beginning of the pilot episode, traditional television episodes cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, so that's a tiny budget for a full season.)]]></description>

That&#8217;s why <a href="http://www.mobcaster.com">Mobcaster</a> has launched a new platform where creators can ask fans for the financial support to produce their shows.</p>
<p>The startup just had its first funding success story — <em><a href="http://mobcaster.com/project/the-weatherman">The Weatherman</a></em>, an Australian-produced comedy about, yes, a weatherman, which has raised the funding needed for its first season. The production company set a goal of $72,500, and it raised $73,975. (As the team notes at the beginning of the pilot episode, traditional television episodes cost hundreds of thousands of dollars at the very least, so that&#8217;s a tiny budget for a full season.)</p>
<p>In many ways, Mobcaster is clearly modeled on Kickstarter. Members donate however much they want, they receive rewards for different donation levels (if you donated $100 to <em>The Weatherman</em>, you would receive a full Producer credit, for example), and you only pay if the project reaches the minimum donation level to get made. However, co-founder Aubrey Levy points out that Kickstarter doesn&#8217;t have many TV success stories, and whereas Mobcaster is designed specifically for the television model.</p>
<p>Creators first raise money for a pilot episode, usually by uploading a pitch and pilot script. Then, after they&#8217;ve shot the pilot, they can use it to fundraise for a six-episode season — which is shorter than most American TV seasons, but keeps the funding needed to a manageable level. (That&#8217;s also the length of a normal British TV season.) Shows can continue for as long as the creators want, raising money one season at a time.</p>
<p>Levy says Mobcaster provides another crucial piece of the puzzle — distribution. The vision is to turn the site into both a crowdfunding platform and an online video channel. Otherwise, creators raise money for a show but have no place to broadcast it, and are forced to &#8220;post and pray&#8221; for an audience. Levy argues that people don&#8217;t go to any of the existing video sites for an independent TV experience. On YouTube, they expect short-form amateur content (and music videos), and on the other end you have Hulu, where people want traditional TV shows.</p>
<p>Mobcaster will run ads with the videos and split the revenue 50-50 with the creators. And the creators own all the intellectual property, so if there&#8217;s interest, a show might actually make the transition to traditional TV (and Mobcaster gets a small cut of the payment).</p>
<p>Levy, by the way, was a digital media strategist at HBO, and he says he spent six or seven months pitching a TV show the old-fashioned way. Like most pitches, it never made it on-air, and thanks to network feedback, Levy says the show had actually got worse throughout the process. Not surprisingly, Mobcaster was built in response to those experiences — it gives the creators complete creative control, and it puts the show&#8217;s survival in the hands of the fans. (Think of all the fan campaigns to save canceled shows like <em>Arrested Development </em> and <em>Firefly</em>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately the TV show is being made for you, so you&#8217;re the only person who should make the decision on whether the show should live or die,&#8221; he says.</p>

We know PayPal has a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/paypal-offers-sneak-peek-of-upcoming-virtual-wallet-offering/58145">major vision</a> for how payments will be made in the future, but today, the company is <a href="https://www.thepaypalblog.com/2012/03/sxsw-paypal-to-give-attendees-first-look-at-new-digital-wallet/">giving us</a> a glimpse of exactly what new features will be added to the platform in the coming year.</p>
<p>As PayPal&#8217;s director of communications Anuj Nayar tells us in an interview, &#8220;PayPal is changing, and this is the first major revamp of the core PayPal product. We&#8217;re known as an online payments brand but this is all part of PayPal becoming an actual wallet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Shrauger, Vice President of Global Product and Experience for PayPal, says that the &#8220;new PayPal&#8221; will &#8220;let consumers do things with their money that have never been possible before.&#8221; One of these features is the ability to have flexibility with how you want to pay for an item in a store. So let&#8217;s say you purchase a computer from a store or online with your Starwood credit card but realize that you actually have a Best Buy credit that you wanted to use.</p>
<p>With the new digital wallet, you can buy something in a store, take it home and decide later how you want to pay for it. PayPal will offer a five to seven-day grace period for consumers to change their minds. So you can switch from one funding source to another, decide to pay over time in installments and even apply different sources of value (gift cards, airline miles, loyalty points, etc.) to a payment.</p>
<p>As we heard from PayPal over the holidays, data is going to be a huge part of the payments company&#8217;s product strategy over time. The new version of PayPal will allow you to create personal lists of items you want. Via PayPal, you can search for items, compare prices and create lists of things you want to buy for a variety of situations. PayPal will then find deals and coupons for these items on your list whether you are in the store or online.</p>
<p>Additionally, you&#8217;ll be able to create spending rules that tie specific cards and payment instruments to specific merchants. So you can create specific “set asides” like travel funds and set rules by purchase amount. For example, you can earmark a bank account for all grocery store purchases, and a specific credit card for entertainment and travel directly from PayPal. All you&#8217;ll need to do is pay via PayPal, and the platform will automatically recognize whether a specific payment should be drawn from a credit card or bank account.</p>
<p>As Shrauger writes in a post announcing these new features, &#8220;PayPal is not about replacing a card swipe with a phone tap at point of sale. We are reimagining money to free it in its digital form so that it can work better for everyone. These features and examples are only the beginning: moving forward, we’re only limited by our ability to imagine what’s possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nayar explains that there will be &#8220;an avalanche&#8221; of product announcements that will bring these features to life in the coming year, starting in late May. &#8220;This will be your new PayPal account,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>This new wallet will also be able to be used with the new in-store experience at retailers (and perhaps at small businesses as well). PayPal clearly wants to become the digital wallet provider for consumers, but the company already has a number of competitors vying for this spot. Google seems to also have major ambitions to dominate in this space with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/19/techcrunch-review-google-wallet/">Google Wallet.</a> We&#8217;re seeing other competitors enter the space, especially in mobile. And we still don&#8217;t what Apple&#8217;s intentions are when it comes to the wallet.</p>
<p>But there are a few things in PayPal&#8217;s favor. First, the company already has an established user base of over 100 million active users. Second, PayPal is device-agnostic and can be layered over the web, mobile, and other platforms. The company hasn&#8217;t revealed any new mobile plans today, but that&#8217;s also sure to be a significant component of the digital wallet&#8217;s technology.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/vic_gundotra_250px.jpeg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="vic_gundotra_250px" title="vic_gundotra_250px" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Today at his <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100078">SXSW fireside chat</a>, head of Google+ Vic Gundotra said &#8220;I am 100% to blame&#8221; for the social network lacking an API seven months after launch. The reason? &#8220;Your stream could easily be overwhelmed&#8221; if Google allowed third-party apps to post content on users&#8217; behalf.</p>
<p>Additionally, Gundotra criticized Facebook&#8217;s inclusion of ads on photo albums and said that only a &#8220;very small number of people have turned off social search&#8221;.</p>
<p>Gundotra made no guarantee a third-party posting API would be made available by the end of 2012, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t want to do it because I&#8217;ve seen other [platforms] open APIs, develop an ecosystem of third-party clients, and then shut down the API. I&#8217;m going to release that API when I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;re not going to screw over developers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem with allowing third-party apps to contribute content is that &#8220;if ranking is not good in the stream&#8221;, single apps could publish too many posts and push out authentic content from the people you follow. Gundotra said that &#8220;When Google opens an API, we want you to know we&#8217;re not going to revoke access.&#8221; Moderator Guy Kawasaki quipped that developers are used to rapidly changing APIs from Facebook, but Gundotra snapped back, &#8220;We hold ourselves to a higher standard&#8221;.</p>
<p>In this case, Google&#8217;s late start on social is holding it back. Facebook has had years to refine its EdgeRank algorithm for sorting the news feed and minimizing the impact of noisy friends and apps. Without such data on who and what its users are interested in, Google+ doesn&#8217;t know what to promote and hide</p>
<p>The senior VP of engineering seemed confused, saying &#8220;We get these messages that we&#8217;re a ghost town&#8221; but developers are still eager for access. Well guess what? If users could cross-publish posts to Google+ the way that apps like Path allow syndication to Facebook and Twitter, maybe the network wouldn&#8217;t feel so dead. Overwhelmed might be better than underwhelmed</p>

But <a href="http://www.hackpad.com">HackPad</a> has a more serious idea: actually taking notes about the panels and keynotes you go to, with other people who care.</p>
<p>It sounds dangerously productive for the fun-oriented event. And it is &#8212; this is one of the better live group word-processing products I&#8217;ve seen in a while.</p>
<p>The interface is nice and simple. You log in with Facebook, or with Google or by creating a new account.  Then you can just start creating and editing docs. Participating users appear on the right side of each page, and each person gets a unique color bar on the left side of where they&#8217;re typing. Live edits are in real-time, so you can watch other users pounding out their own notes while you&#8217;re busy sharing yours.</p>
<p>The top menu includes a simple set of actions for all the main things you need to do. There&#8217;s a plus button for creating new docs, a search bar, and basic WYSIWYG commands including a big button for creating links to other docs or the web (something a lot of editors don&#8217;t show off well in their interfaces).</p>

A list of every panel and talk  is available now at <a href="https://austin.hackpad.com/">austin.hackpad.com</a>, organized by hour and by day. If you&#8217;re here at the rain-soaked conference, or interested in any of the panels, be sure to check it out.</p>
<p>Overall, the Y Combinator-backed company feels like it&#8217;s on the right track for pushing online collaboration forward.</p>

However, around the time that this rumored launch date leaked, the Lumia 900 had yet to go through its testing in the technical acceptance process.

<p>However, around the time that this rumored launch date leaked, the Lumia 900 had yet to go through its testing in the technical acceptance process. Turns out, that may be the reason <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/03/09/atts-nokia-lumia-900-launch-delayed-now-set-to-debut-on-april-22nd-for-99-99/">BGR</a> is now reporting that the Lumia 900 launch has been delayed to April 22. </p>
<p>Luckily, the Lumia 900 will still go for an absolutely ridiculous price point. And when I say ridiculous, it&#8217;s a compliment. While Windows Phone devices haven&#8217;t had the most impressive specs to date, the platform itself and Nokia build quality are certainly worth more than $100. </p>
<p>But that seems to be the strategy with this partnership. </p>
<p>Nokia has seen a rough year, to say the least, and Windows Phone has never really been what Microsoft (or anyone else) would call a success. But all the pieces are falling into place, in terms of the products themselves. Now all Nokiasoft has to do is get people on board with the platform, and that means attractive pricing. </p>

<p>Well, if you want the best bang for your buck, you should probably get dressed and prepare to brave the outside world. Starting in June, any Marvel comic that costs $3.99 or higher (when did comic books get so pricey?) will <a href="http://marvel.com/news/story/18254/top-selling_marvel_comics_to_receive_free_digital_codes">come with a code</a> that lets the purchaser download a digital copy of that same comic via the Marvel Comics app for iOS or Android.</p>
<p>How benevolent. Not every comic will get the two-for-one treatment, but most of Marvel’s biggest names are accounted for thanks to their price tag. Think The Avengers, Amazing Spiderman, Invincible Iron Man, and Captain America, with plenty more to like on the list.</p>
<p>The move isn’t without its downsides though — namely, that you&#8217;ll have to wing your way to the local comic book store and carry out a financial transaction in person. Which is fine, if you’re into that sort of thing, but it’s 2012 dammit and I don’t want to move any more than I have to.</p>
<p>I’m kidding. Really.</p>
<p>Marvel tested the concept last year when they announced that their Ultimate Comics line would come bundled with a digital copy, and the move garnered the comics giant plenty of &#8220;positive reactions from both retailers and fans.&#8221; Of course it did &#8212; fans get free stuff and comic book stores get their business and the potential for increased traffic. Meanwhile, Marvel eats up the goodwill from both parties and builds awareness of their mobile marketplace (and all of its in-app purchases). Everyone&#8217;s a winner!</p>

The product, which was born out of an actual need for a more simplified CRM system, is focused on efficiency, not a complex feature set. It&#8217;s not for adding contracts, managing cases, or allocating tasks to a team of salespeople. Instead, Stride is about deal-tracking and high-level metrics only.</p>
<p>&#8220;For salespeople, this app is going to make them cringe,&#8221; says Stride co-founder Andrew Dumont.</p>
<p>The idea for the app was sparked by <a href="http://twitter.com/nathancarnes" target="_blank">Nathan Carnes</a> and built by the team of <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewdumont" target="_self">Andrew Dumont</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/adrianpike" target="_self">Adrian Pike</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/amielmartin" target="_self">Amiel Martin</a>. Carnes explains the history of Stride&#8217;s creation via a <a href="http://blog.strideapp.com/post/18976926872/origin-story">blog post</a> detailing the frustrations he had running a small design shop and not being able to find a CRM system that fit his needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t need multiple salespeople or complicated reports,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and I didn’t have time to enter contacts and manage them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giving up on finding a solution, Carnes decided to build one instead. That&#8217;s something that often leads to inspired ideas, frankly. And Stride, which looks attractive, simple and accessible, may just be one of those.</p>
<p>Andrew Dumont tells me that he felt similar to Carnes about the current state of the CRM market. Everything he used (<a href="http://highrisehq.com/">Highrise</a>, <a href="http://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, <a href="http://capsulecrm.com/">Capsule</a>, <a href="http://www.futuresimple.com/base/">Base</a>, etc.) were always &#8220;way too complex and clunky,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to think of Stride as the consumerization of sales tracking,&#8221; explains Dumont.</p>
<p>In Stride, the whole system is focused on deal-tracking, meaning any relationship that has a dollar value associated with it is entered into Slide. The deal name and status are in blue, the value (dollar amt.) is off to the right in green, and there are buttons that let you quickly change the deal&#8217;s status (lead, pitch, negotiation, closing, won) as well as buttons that let you pause, indicate if the deal is lost, edit the deal, or delete it.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/tumblr_m0lhenls551rotpt5o1_1280.png" rel="lightbox[515387]"></a></p>
<p>Deals can also be drag-and-dropped on the dashboard, so you can organize them as you see fit.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/stride1.jpeg" rel="lightbox[515387]"></a></p>
<p>A simplified metrics section shows you the key figures you need to track: active deal value, average value, number of active deals and deals all-time. Pie charts further break down things like time and value in each step and number of deals won and lost, for example.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/stride2.jpeg" rel="lightbox[515387]"></a></p>
<p>The simplicity of the product is promising &#8211; CRM for anyone, clearly &#8211; but there&#8217;s certainly room for Stride to grow to meet users&#8217; demands for some slightly more complex features in the future. Although after small businesses, some owners may want to have multiple people to sign in and track deals under their own names, for example, or they may want a bit more detail to the reporting options. Given that product&#8217;s <a href="https://strideapp.com/users/sign_up">pricing</a> starts at free (for 25 deals) and go up to $7/month for unlimited deals, adding a few carefully considered enhancements for a slight price bump seems reasonable, without worrying about the app moving into Salesforce territory.</p>
<p>Dumont tells me that, indeed, the plan is to add features in the near future, but to keep the focus on simplicity. Specifically, Stride will soon roll out a feature that will lets users add, edit and remove certain steps of the sales flow process to better fit their flow. The company is also adding email reminders and integrations with Quickbooks, Freshbooks, Rapportive and more, which will help reduce the complexity of using the system. And yes, they&#8217;re going mobile too, and plan to launch on iOS first.</p>
